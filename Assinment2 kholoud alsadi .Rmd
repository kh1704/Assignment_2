The boxplot for the Height variable is symmetric, while those for Girth and Volume are right skewed, and there is one outlier on the Volume boxplot.
```{r trees3, echo=FALSE}
par(mfrow=c(1, 3))
boxplot(trees$Girth, main="Girth")
boxplot(trees$Height, main="Height")
boxplot(trees$Volume, main="Volume")
par(mfrow=c(1, 1))
```
